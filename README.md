# 8-bit CPU Design – Logisim Project

## 🎓 Overview
This project was developed during my **first year of Embedded Systems Engineering** studies at **INSA Hauts-de-France (April – June 2023)**.  
The goal was to **design and simulate a simple 8-bit CPU** using Logisim, in order to understand the internal architecture of a processor.

## ⚙️ Main Features
- Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)
- Control Unit
- Program Counter & Instruction Register
- Clock and memory connections
- 8-bit data bus

## 🧠 Key Learnings
- Digital logic design (combinational and sequential)
- CPU architecture and instruction flow
- Hardware simulation using Logisim
